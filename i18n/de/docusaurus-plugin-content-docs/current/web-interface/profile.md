# Profile

##### An explanation of the profile tab

Your profile is directly linked with your Minecraft account. You can either use the realms menu (`/realm`) to generate a direct login link or log in using your UUID and password.

You can set a new password on the profile page and activate 2-Factor-Authentication.

Additionally, you're able to create an api key which gives you access to the [Pterodactyl API](./ptero-api) and ssh keys which you can use for an easier login process for SFTP.

## How to create an API key

To generate an API key, firstly log into the web interface and go to the following page: [https://realms.cytooxien.de/account/api](https://realms.cytooxien.de/account/api). From there, enter a description and optionally add IPs which are allowed to access the API. Then press on "Create" and the key will be shown to you. Remember to copy it right now, as it'll be shown to you only once.
