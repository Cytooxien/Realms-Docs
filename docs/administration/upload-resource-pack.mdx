# Upload Your Own Resource Pack

##### In this guide, we'll show you step-by-step how to upload your own resource pack.

You have your own resource pack but don't know how to upload it to your Realm? No problem.

    1. You need a direct download link for your resource pack. You can also use an free hoster.

    2. Open the web interface of your Realm.

    3. Navigate to the **[Files](../web-interface/file-manager)** section.

    4. Look for the file called `server.properties` and click on it.

    5. Search for the line `resource-pack=` using CTRL + F.

    6. Paste the url at the end of that line. 

        For example: `resource-pack=https://example.com/resourcepack.zip`
        
    7. It's recommended to also include the SHA1-Hash of the resource pack. For this look [below](#generate-sha1-of-resource-pack).

        Paste this SHA1-Hash in the `resource-pack-sha1=` line.
       
        For example: `resource-pack-sha1=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709`

    8. Save the file and restart your Realm.

### Generate SHA1 of resource pack

You can use an online tool like https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha1_checksum.html.

The SHA1 can also be generated using the command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash resourcePack.zip -Algorithm SHA1
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    ```bash
    sha1sum resourcePack.zip
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
