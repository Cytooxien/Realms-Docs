# Upload Your Own Texture Pack

##### In this guide, we'll show you step-by-step how to upload your own texture pack.

You have your own texture pack but don't know how to upload it to your Realm? No problem.

    1. Open the web interface of your Realm.

    2. Navigate to the “Files” section.

    3. Look for the file called `server.properties` and click on it.

    4. Press CTRL + F to search for the line `texturepack=`.

    5. Open a new tab in your browser and search for: `minecraft texturepack host`
    (We recommend the first result, https://mc-packs.net – but you can use any other host as well.)

    6. Drag and drop your texturepack or select it manually.

    7. After uploading, you will receive a download link. Copy this link.

    8. Go back to `server.properties` and paste the link after `texturepack=` (e.g., texturepack=https://yourhost.net/w3ethiswzarticleefisejawesome).

    9. Save the file and restart your Realm.
