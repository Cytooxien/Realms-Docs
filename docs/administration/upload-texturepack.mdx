# Upload Your Own Texture Pack

##### In this guide, we'll show you step-by-step how to upload your own texture pack.

You have your own texture pack but don't know how to upload it to your Realm? No problem.

    1. Open the web interface of your Realm.

    2. Navigate to the “[Files](../web-interface/file-manager)” section.

    3. Look for the file called `server.properties` and click on it.

    4. Delete the lines with `resource-pack=` and `resource-pack-sha1=`. Using CTRL + F you can search for these.

    5. Open a new tab in your browser and search for: `minecraft texturepack host`
    (We recommend the first result, [Mc-packs](https://mc-packs.net) – but you can use any other host as well.)

    6. Drag and drop your texturepack or select it manually.

    7. Copy the two lines in the right column and insert these in `server.properties`.

    9. Save the file and restart your Realm.
