# Overview

##### This article will give you an explanation on the different types of help you can get and how to get them

### Introduction

You've probably been in this situation at least once while developing your realm: You need help with something.
Either you can't figure out how to do a specific thing, or you've encountered a problem you can't find a solution to.
This feeling can be frustrating at times, but it's important to note that if you know how to properly get help, you won't have to worry about it.

### Types of getting help

There are a lot of different ways you can get help with something. Either someone does it for you, or someone instructs you how to do something. This section will give you a brief overview on the ways you can get help with.

#### 1. Figuring out a solution yourself by learning how to do it

This is by far the superior method of getting help. The easiest way how to do it is by finding things on the internet which can help you.
Sometimes even a quick Google search which leads you to the documentation to the thing you want help with can help you a lot. Documentation (just as this one) is designed to teach you how to do things.

This is the best way to learn how to do something, and you will have a better understanding of how things work. This will also help you in the future when you encounter similar problems.
If you want to know how to do a specific thing, this is the best way to go.

Most of the articles in [this](../how-to-get-help) category will teach you how to figure things out yourself.

#### 2. Asking the community for help

Another way to get help is by asking the community. This is usually done by using the `realms-help` forum on the Cytooxien Discord server ([discord.gg/cytooxien](https://discord.gg/cytooxien)).
This is a great way to get help, because you can ask people who have experience with the thing you need help with. This can be very helpful, because they can give you tips and tricks on how to do things, and they can also help you figure out what you're doing wrong.
It's important to note that you shouldn't expect people to do your work for you, so still try to engage with the people who help you and try to resolve the issue yourself while people are helping you. If you ask for help, make sure to provide as much information as possible about the problem you're facing. This will help people understand what you're trying to do and how they can help you.

There are also so-called Realms-Helpers. These are people who have shown a lot of experience with the Realms system. They also have close connections to the Cytooxien team, which means that they can forward issues directly to them if needed.
