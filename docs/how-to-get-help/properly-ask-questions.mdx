# How to properly ask questions

##### This article will give you a guide on how to properly ask questions in the `realms-help` forum on the Discord server

### Introduction

When you ask a question in the `realms-help` forum, it's important to provide as much information as possible.

This will help the people who are trying to help you understand your problem better and give you a more accurate answer.

### Before you ask a question

Sometimes, you don't even need to ask the entire community when you can find the answer yourself.

Before asking a question, make sure to check the following things:

1. Have you searched the internet for a solution?

    *(Also includes the `realms-help` forum, use the Discord search feature to see whether someone has maybe already had such an issue)*

2. Have you checked the documentation of the plugin you're using?

3. Have you checked the server logs for any error messages ([tutorial here](./reading-logs))?

### Asking the question

When creating a post in the forum, you need to include the following things in your message:

- Context about what happened
- Server log files
- List of plugins on your realm
- What you've already tried to resolve the issue
- *Screenshots or videos (if needed to explain the issue)*

Make sure to use precise language and spell-check your messages.
People will more likely help you if they're able to actually understand you.

Additionally, follow the [Discord server rules](https://cytooxien.net/help/discord-rules).

### Things to avoid

- Not responding to questions that are being asked by users, this makes it much harder for them to help you
- Splitting sentences into multiple messages (e.g: message 1: `But`, message 2: `what`, message 3: `should`, message 4: `I`, message 5: `do`, message 6: `?`)
- Being impatient, people still have a life, and they also have something else to do rather than answering questions 24/7
- Pinging team members, especially multiple ones
- Creating multiple posts or cross-posting the question in multiple channels
