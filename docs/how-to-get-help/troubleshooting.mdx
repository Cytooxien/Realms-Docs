# Troubleshooting

##### This article explains the core principles of troubleshooting issues with your realm

### Introduction

When you're working on your realm, you might encounter a problem that you can't figure out from in-game, such as a server crash or a plugin not working as intended.

This is where troubleshooting comes in. Troubleshooting is the process of diagnosing and fixing issues with your realm.

### Common issues

There are a lot of issues which can occur on your realm. Most of them are caused by plugins which are on your realm or by misconfiguration.

#### Plugin-induced issues

Plugin-induced issues can be the most frustrating ones to find a solution to, as a lot of plugins aren't documented that well.

Below is a list of the most common ones, which don't have something to do with configuration, as some principles are different for every plugin.

To find the type of the issue, [going through the server's logs](./reading-logs) mostly helps to find it.

##### A dependency plugin is missing/out of date

You can determine that it's such an issue if you see something similar to the following error message on your server:

```
[18:53:17 ERROR]: [ModernPluginLoadingStrategy] Could not load 'plugins/MyPlugin.jar' in 'plugins'
org.bukkit.plugin.UnknownDependencyException: Unknown/missing dependency plugins: [SomeLibrary]. Please download and install these plugins to run 'MyPlugin'.
        at io.papermc.paper.plugin.entrypoint.strategy.modern.ModernPluginLoadingStrategy.loadProviders(ModernPluginLoadingStrategy.java:82) ~[server.jar:1.21.1-DEV-4430e96]
        at io.papermc.paper.plugin.storage.SimpleProviderStorage.enter(SimpleProviderStorage.java:38) ~[server.jar:1.21.1-DEV-4430e96]
        at io.papermc.paper.plugin.manager.RuntimePluginEntrypointHandler.enter(RuntimePluginEntrypointHandler.java:40) ~[server.jar:1.21.1-DEV-4430e96]
        at io.papermc.paper.plugin.manager.PaperPluginInstanceManager.loadPlugins(PaperPluginInstanceManager.java:147) ~[server.jar:1.21.1-DEV-4430e96]
        at io.papermc.paper.plugin.manager.PaperPluginManagerImpl.loadPlugins(PaperPluginManagerImpl.java:87) ~[server.jar:1.21.1-DEV-4430e96]
        at org.bukkit.plugin.SimplePluginManager.loadPlugins(SimplePluginManager.java:128) ~[paper-mojangapi-1.21.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:?]
        at org.bukkit.plugin.SimplePluginManager.loadPlugins(SimplePluginManager.java:121) ~[paper-mojangapi-1.21.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:?]
[...]
```

Most importantly, the message saying `org.bukkit.plugin.UnknownDependencyException: Unknown/missing dependency plugins: [SomeLibrary]` tells you which plugins require which dependencies.

The easiest way to fix this issue is to find the dependency on the internet and upload it onto the server.

##### TPS loss/Lag spikes

TPS loss can not only happen because of a lot of entities in a world, but also because of plugins (including Skripts).

To find out whether performance issues come up because of a plugin, the recommended tool is the [spark profiler](https://spark.lucko.me).

To use it, execute the command `/spark profiler start --timeout 300` and after 5 minutes you'll get a link to the web viewer with all the necessary statistics.

Now it's recommended to follow [the official spark documentation](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Using-the-viewer) to find the source of the lag, specifically look for plugin names listed in the viewer.

#### Non-plugin-induced issues

There are, of course, also issues that didn't come from plugins.
They're usually not caused by you and are instead due to issues with the Realms system, though in some cases, user actions can also be responsible.

It's always a good idea to create a post in the `realms-help` forum on the Cytooxien Discord server ([discord.gg/cytooxien](https://discord.gg/cytooxien)) if you encounter a non-plugin-induced issue.
As previously explained, they usually happen because of issues with the Realms system itself, so it's a good idea to inform the team about these issues so that they can be fixed.

##### Attempting loading of chunk saved with a newer server version

If you encounter a server crash on startup, with the following in the server logs:

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Server attempted to load chunk saved with newer version of minecraft! 3955 > 3465
```

this happened because the world that the server is trying to load is on a newer version than the server is on.

It is not possible to easily resolve this issue as the world might corrupt when downgrading its version.
Of course, it *is* possible to do so, but it's absolutely not recommended and you should always take backups before doing anything.
