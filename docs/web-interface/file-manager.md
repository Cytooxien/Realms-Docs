# File Manager

##### How to properly use the file manager

The file manager is used for managing your realm's files. You can create and upload files using the buttons at the top or by using drag and drop.
Existing files can also be edited. In the editor, you can choose a syntax highlighting mode, which is typically set automatically based on the file extension.

If you want to move a file into its root directory use `../`. For example: `../folder` is the folder `folder` in the root directory of the file.

You can also do it with SFTP using the [settings](./other-tabs) tab.
