# Console

##### An explanation of the features the console page offers

[//]: # (![console]&#40;console.png&#41;)

The console shows important information about your realm. You can view the console output of the server and execute commands.
If there's a problem, the console gives important details to help others fix it.

The sidebar is split into several sections:

1. **Realm Controls:**  
   The four buttons at the top let you start, restart, stop, or unload your realm.

2. **Uptime:**  
   Shows how long your realm has been running.
   Your realm could also be paused. That means it hasn't been used for a long time.
   Once a player joins, the server continues like normal.

3. **CPU Usage:**  
   Shows how much CPU your realm is using.
   If you see a âš¡ icon, it means your realm is in Turbo Launch mode, which makes it start faster.

4. **RAM Usage:**  
   Shows how much RAM your realm is using and how much is available.

5. **Disk Usage:**  
   Shows how much of the realm's hard drive is being used.
   If this goes over the limit, your realm will stop.

6. **Incoming Network Data:**  
   Shows how much traffic is coming into your realm.

7. **Outgoing Network Data:**  
   Shows how much traffic is going out of your realm.

8. **Boost Count:**  
   Shows how many boosts your realm has.

9. **Online Players:**  
   Shows who's currently online on your realm.

Below the console, you can see graphs showing the history of CPU, RAM, and network usage.
