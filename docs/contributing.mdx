# Contributing

##### This article will give you an overview on how to contribute to the project

### Overview

You can either suggest topics, or you can directly write an article to a topic you think should be in the docs.
Even pointing out mistakes which we might have missed would help out a ton.
Contributing to the docs requires a GitHub account and at least some experience using the platform.
Support for writing articles will not be provided.

### Suggesting topics/pointing out issues

In order to suggest a topic or point out an issue, create an issue on our GitHub repository and select the correct template.
You can find the issue page [here](https://github.com/Cytooxien/Realms-Docs/issues).

### Writing articles for the docs

#### Quick start guide

1. Fork the repository: [https://github.com/Cytooxien/Realms-Docs.git](https://github.com/Cytooxien/Realms-Docs.git)
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Realms-Docs.git` (of course replace the username and the name of the repository)
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/yourFeatureName` (follow the camelCase styling for the feature name)
4. Make your changes (make sure to follow the documentation guidelines found below)
5. Test your changes locally (not only in the dev environment but also after building the project, also look out for typos or grammar mistakes)
6. Submit a pull request with the changes you made (make sure to include a description that clearly describes what the feature changes and screenshots if necessary)

#### Development commands

You must have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.

```bash
# Installation
npm install

# Local Development
docusaurus start # alternatively: `npm run start`

# Local Development with german translations
docusaurus start --locale de # sometimes running `npm run start --locale de` doesn't work

# Build
docusaurus build # alternatively: `npm run build`
```

### Documentation guidelines

#### File structure guidelines

All articles belong into the `docs` folder. Each article (except for this one) needs to be in a subfolder which serves as a category.

Articles which are written in german belong into the `i8n/de/docusaurus-content-docs/current` folder.

The home page, the CSS files, and other React components are located in the `src` folder and in their respective subfolders.

Images belong into the `static/img` folder.
Images which are being used in articles are located in the `static/img/en` folder for images with english texts.
Images which have german texts belong into the `static/img/de` folder.

#### Writing guidelines

##### Markdown guidelines

- Use markdown headers (such as `#` for h1, `##` for h2, etc)
- Use backticks for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks
- Include an alt text for all images

##### Layout guidelines

Every file should have the following at the beginning of it to allow navigation between articles.
These should be in the order of how the articles are being displayed in the sidebar to avoid confusion:

```
pagination_prev: # link to the previous article (for example: getting-started/player-management)
pagination_next: # link to the next article (for example: getting-started/world-management)
```

Next, the title for the article is written using a `#`-tag. Keep it short and use title-style capitalization.

After that, write a short description of the article using a `#####`-tag. It should be one sentence.

Titles inside the article should start with `###` and add more hashtags for every indentation level.

When images are being used in English articles, they need to be declared using:
```mdx
![alt text](../../static/img/en/<category>/<desciptive name>)
```
When they're being used in German articles, they need to be declared using:
```mdx
![alt text in german](../../../../../static/img/de/<category>/<name same as for the english image>)
```

##### Style guidelines

- Keep sentences short and concise
- Break up long paragraphs into smaller ones
- Use active voice
- Try avoiding informal language
- Complex concepts or terminology should have an explanation, or a link to an explanation should be given
- Link to other parts of the docs if they're mentioned
- Use images when explaining GUIs

##### Image guidelines

- Images need to be in the file format webp (use an online converter to convert them)
- Images need to only include the most important information (crop them to only include what you're trying to show)
- The filenames for images need to be unique and descriptive (don't name them `Screenshot-<date>.webp` or similar), the same applies to alt texts
- When showing GUIs, photoshop the images to only show the GUI itself and not the world in the background ([example here](https://cytooxien.github.io/Realms-Docs/docs/getting-started/world-management))

### Translating articles

Every article needs to be available in both English and German as a large part of the Realms community speaks German.
Thus, before opening a pull request, make sure to have the content changes you made translated into German.

Generally speaking, the translated articles are located in the `i8n/de/docusaurus-content-docs/current` as previously explained in the file structure guidelines.

So if you decide to write an article, copy it into the German directory **(make sure to keep the folder structure and file names the same)** and translate it into German.
Make sure to keep the information the same for both languages.

### Adding your article to the sidebar

To make your article appear in the sidebar, first open the `sidebars.ts` file in the project folder.
Then, add your article to either a category it belongs into or create a new one.

Below is an example:
```ts
{
    type: "category",
    label: "Web Interface",
    collapsed: true,
    link: {
        type: "generated-index",
        slug: "web-interface"
    },
    items: [
        "web-interface/console",
        "web-interface/file-manager",
        "web-interface/advanced-configuration",
        "web-interface/other-tabs",
        "web-interface/profile",
        "web-interface/ptero-api",
        "web-interface/your-new-article" // Add your new article, make sure to keep the order of the items in the sidebar the same as for the navigation buttons
    ]
}
```

Now you've added your article to the sidebar.

#### How to add a newly created category to the sidebar

To create a new category, use the following and replace the placeholder values:

```ts
{
    type: "category",
    label: "", // Name for the category
    link: {
        type: "generated-index",
        slug: "" // This is what will be used when linking to the category
    },
    items: [
        // Add the articles, make sure to keep the order of the items in the sidebar the same as for the navigation buttons
    ]
}
```

Now after you've done that, open the `current.json` file in the `i8n/de/docusaurus-content-docs` folder and add the following (of course replace the necessary values):

```json
{
  "sidebar.mainSidebar.category.<label of your category>": {
    "message": "<category name in German>",
    "description": "The label for category <category name> in sidebar mainSidebar"
  }
}
```
