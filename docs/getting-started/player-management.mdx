# Player Management

##### This guide will explain how to use the player management

When running a realm, managing its players is crucial for keeping a stable community. An easy way to do that is by using the player management system.

You access it by once again executing the <code>/realm</code> command in game, and then you click the player icon in the bottom left corner.

### Overview

Now you see a list of the players who've joined your realm at one point. In the bottom left corner, you can filter the players between the following categories: `all`, `online` and `banned`. In the bottom right corner you can search for a specific player, and they'll be shown regardless of whether they've been on the realm or not.

### How to manage a player

By clicking on a player's head or by searching for them using the search function mentioned earlier, you'll be shown a small overview where you can see the player's name, their primary group, and a few buttons at the bottom. Let's go through all of them one by one.

##### Assign groups

Using the player overview, you're also able to assign groups to players. Click the edit icon next to the player's primary group name, and you'll be shown a GUI where you can select the groups to add to said player.

##### Teleport to player

It teleports you to the player. Doesn't work if the player is offline.

##### Kick player

It kicks the player from the realm. They'll be able to join back.

##### Ban player

It bans the player from the realm. You're also able to select the ban reason and the ban duration. Once a player is banned, they won't be able to join the realm unless they've been unbanned.

If a player is banned from the realm, you can unban them by clicking the button `Unban player`. They'll be unbanned, no matter how long their ban duration was, and they'll be able to join the realm.
